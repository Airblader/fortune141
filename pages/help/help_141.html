            <i>Straight pool</i>, which is also known as <i>14.1 (continous)</i>, is a pool discipline that requires
            players to continously keep track of the score on a score sheet. Making this task easier and provding
            statistics about the games is one of the main purposes of Fortune 14/1.

            <h3>Game Setup</h3>
            
            <p style="white-space: normal;">
                Setting up a straight pool game is very straight-forward: Simply tap on either player to display
                the list of player profiles and choose one from there, or tap and hold on it to enter the name
                for a player you don't want to create a profile for (i.e. tournament opponents you will only play once).
            </p>
            <div data-role="collapsible">
                <h3>Setup Options</h3>
                
                <ul data-role="listview">
                    <li>
                        <p style="white-space: normal;"><strong>Score Goal</strong></p>
                        <p style="white-space: normal;">
                            The score goal sets the amount of points a player needs to get to win the game.
                        </p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p style="white-space: normal;"><strong>Game Mode</strong></p>
                        <p style="white-space: normal;">
                            Game modes allow you to tag games. This can be useful to differentiate between practice
                            and league games, for example to allow separate statistics for each mode.
                        </p>
                        <p style="white-space: normal;">
                            Note: Fortune 14/1 memorizes the score goal and puts it as the pre-set value for the next
                            game you set up.
                        </p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p style="white-space: normal;"><strong>Innings Limit</strong></p>
                        
                        <p style="white-space: normal;">
                            Rather than just setting the score goal, you can also additionally set a maximum number of
                            innings to be played. If you set this to 0, there will be no limit on the number of innings.
                        </p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p style="white-space: normal;"><strong>Innings Extension</strong></p>
                        
                        <p style="white-space: normal;">
                            If you set a limit for the innings and you reach this limit while having tied scores, this
                            number will determine how many additional innings will be played. In any case, both players will
                            be guaranteed to get the same number of additional innings. Set this value to 0 to allow
                            the game to end with a tied score.
                        </p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p style="white-space: normal;"><strong>Handicap</strong></p>
                        
                        <p style="white-space: normal;">
                            If you play against a person who plays significantly stronger or weaker than you, it might be
                            a good idea to make the game more fair by setting up a handicap. Fortune 14/1 allows you to either
                            set a certain amount of points as a headstart or a multiplicator with which the points this player
                            makes will be multiplied.
                        </p>
                        <p style="white-space: normal;">
                            Note: The 15 points penalty will not be affected by the multiplicator.
                        </p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p style="white-space: normal;"><strong>Game Profiles</strong></p>
                        
                        <p style="white-space: normal;">
                            Most players only use a limited number of game setups, for example for league and practice games.
                            To avoid having to set up the game over and over again, you can create game profiles that you
                            can simply load by selecting the profile you wish to use and hit the load button.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Usage of these game modes will also be memorized and for convencience the game mode you use
                            the most will be the default one selected when setting up a game, so that you only need to hit
                            the load button.
                        </p>

            <h3>In-Game</h3>
            
            <p style="white-space: normal;">
                Straight pool is a complex game with many possible scenarios. Fortune 14/1 tries to provide you with the possibility
                to capture every scenario you can think of, while focussing on only having the most common ones directly available
                for easy usage.
            </p>
            <p style="white-space: normal;">
                By the way: Fortune 14/1 will save games automatically, so even if the app crashes, when you close it or when you
                run out of battery, you can resume the game later on in the "Resume Game" menu.
            </p>

                    <p style="white-space: normal;"><strong>Basic Usage</strong></p>
                    
                    <p style="white-space: normal;">
                        Simply select the number of balls that remain on the table when an inning ends or the balls are reracked,
                        mark the inning with fouls or as a safety if needed and tap "Accept". Fortune 14/1 will do all the
                        calculations for you.
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p style="white-space: normal;"><strong>New Rack</strong></p>
                    
                    <p style="white-space: normal;">
                        If the balls are reracked during an inning, simply select either the 1-ball (typical scenario) or
                        the cue ball (if all balls were made in the last shot) and hit Accept. Fortune 14/1 will automatically
                        start a new inning.
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p style="white-space: normal;"><strong>Fouls</strong></p>
                    
                    <p style="white-space: normal;">
                        Simply tap the "Fouls" button to add or remove a foul before hitting "Accept". In most cases, this will
                        toggle between no fouls and a normal foul (which is -1 points). In certain cases, most typically for the
                        first shot of the game, there will also be a toggle state for severe fouls (which is -2 points).
                    </p>
                    <p style="white-space: normal;">
                        Fortune 14/1 will memorize consecutive fouls automatically. If a player is up to two consecutive fouls,
                        a warning will be triggered. This is meant to support fair play as the rules typically require you
                        to remind your opponent of being in this situation before he takes his shot. If a player fouls three
                        times in a row, he will additionally be punished with -15 points. Additionally, the balls will be reracked
                        and you will be given the option to switch which player continues to play.
                    </p>
                    <p style="white-space: normal;">
                        Certain situations, like unsportsmanlike conduct, result in other punishments. If you tap and hold the
                        foul button, you can manually enter an arbitrary number of points as a punishment. Optionally, you
                        can also check whether the balls should be reracked.
                    </p>

                    <p style="white-space: normal;"><strong>Safety</strong></p>
                    
                    <p style="white-space: normal;">
                        If an inning ends with the player calling a safety, you can mark this inning as a safety. While being
                        irrelevant for the score or result of the game in any way, this is useful information for calculating
                        statistics.

                    <p style="white-space: normal;">
                        The button to switch players will only be visible when switching turns is available, i.e. in the
                        beginning of the game or after a severe foul that caused a rerack.
                    </p>

                <li>

                    <p style="white-space: normal;">
                        Clicking on either "Details" button will bring up a scoreboard where you can see the score sheet
                        in the way you typically would write it down. In addition to that you will be shown the average
                        points per inning and the highest number of balls made in one inning for each player. Simply
                        tap the scoreboard to go back to the game.
                    </p>

                    <p style="white-space: normal;">
                        In the Details tab you will also find an "Undo" button that allows you to undo previous actions
                        in case you made a mistake. You can go back any number of actions, but only if they have been
                        made in the current session. This means: Closing and resumg a game will result in the loss of
                        the ability to undo actions.
