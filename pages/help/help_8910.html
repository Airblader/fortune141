            <i>8-/9-/10-Ball</i> are the most common game types in pool billiards and are played in most tournaments
            and leagues around the world. Keeping track of the score is a lot easier than in straight pool, but
            keeping track of statistics remains a tedious task. Fortune 14/1 will take this work off your hand and
            also allow you to keep track of matches with multiple sets.

            <h3>Game Setup</h3>

            <p style="white-space: normal;">
                Setting up a 8-/9-/10-ball game is very straight-forward: Simply tap on either player to display
                the list of player profiles and choose one from there, or tap and hold on it to enter the name
                for a player you don't want to create a profile for (i.e. tournament opponents you will only play once).
            </p>

                        <p style="white-space: normal;">
                            Choose whether you are playing 8-, 9- or 10-ball. This has no effect on the app and
                            is purely for statistical purposes.

                        <p style="white-space: normal;">
                            Choosing whether you are playing winner break, loser break or alternate break is mostly
                            for statistical purposes, but if you are using a shot clock it will automatically set
                            the correct player for you. If activated in the settings, you will also be notified which
                            player has to break next during alternate break matches &ndash; just in case you forget.

                        <p style="white-space: normal;">
                            Game modes allow you to tag games. This can be useful to differentiate between practice
                            and league games, for example to allow separate statistics for each mode.
                        </p>

                        <p style="white-space: normal;">
                            This is the number of racks a player has to win in order to win the set/game.
                        </p>

                        <p style="white-space: normal;">
                            Divide your game into multiple sets: Each set will be played as a "Race To" with the
                            number of racks specified above. The winner of the game will be the player who won
                            the most sets.

                        <p style="white-space: normal;">
                            If set to a value greater than 0, the game will be played with a shot clock. Each player
                            has the number of seconds you specified here for each shot.
                        </p>

                        <p style="white-space: normal;">
                            Each player can call an extension on his basic amount of time. This value specifies
                            how many seconds calling an extension will add to the available time.
                        </p>

                        <p style="white-space: normal;">
                            Define how many extensions each player can call per rack.

                        <p style="white-space: normal;">
                            If activated, a sound will be played when there is only little time left on the clock.
                        </p>

                        <p style="white-space: normal;">
                            Most players only use a limited number of game setups, for example for league and practice games.
                            To avoid having to set up the game over and over again, you can create game profiles that you
                            can simply load by selecting the profile you wish to use and hit the load button.
                        </p>
                        <p style="white-space: normal;">
                            Usage of these game modes will also be memorized and for convencience the game mode you use
                            the most will be the default one selected when setting up a game, so that you only need to hit
                            the load button.

                Fortune 14/1 allows you a high amount of control over your game. If you don't know what a button will do or if
                you want to check whether there is a function you are not aware of, this is the right place for you.
            </p>
            <p style="white-space: normal;">
                By the way: Fortune 14/1 will save games automatically, so even if the app crashes, when you close it or when you
                run out of battery, you can resume the game later on in the "Resume Game" menu.

                    <p style="white-space: normal;">
                        Before you can start the game, you will be asked to select which player has the first break. This
                        will usually be decided with a lag. This is mostly for statistical purposes, but if you're using
                        a shot clock, Fortune 14/1 will set it up correctly for you.

                    <p style="white-space: normal;">
                        Simply tap the picture area of the player who won a rack. Fortune 14/1 will take care of
                        determining the winner of sets or the match.
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p style="white-space: normal;"><strong>Runout</strong></p>
                    
                    <p style="white-space: normal;">
                        If a player ran the whole rack without his opponent ever even coming to the table, taphold
                        instead of tap the picture area. This is for statistical purposes only.
                    </p>

                <li>

                    <p style="white-space: normal;">
                        Tapping the foul markers (red crosses) will toggle the number of consecutive fouls a player
                        currently has. This is nothing more than a utility tool so you won't forget the number.
                        Of course, the number of fouls will reset with every new rack.

                    <p style="white-space: normal;">
                        Accidently hit the wrong button? Or the game situation changed after you entered it? No problem
                        &ndash; Fotune 14/1 will let you take a step back when you tap this button. You can go back
                        any number of steps, but only if they have been made in the current session. This means: Closing
                        and resuming a game will result in the loss of the ability to undo actions prior to this point.

                    <p style="white-space: normal;">
                        If you're using a shot clock, you will see some additional controls. What each button does
                        depends on the situation and how you click it, so read this carefully.
                    </p>
                    <p style="white-space: normal;">
                        The left button reads either "Start" or "Switch" and tapping it will either cause the clock
                        to start running or the current player to switch &ndash; pretty self-explaining actions.
                    </p>
                    <p style="white-space: normal;">
                        If you taphold the left button instead, its meaning will change. If the clock is running,
                        this will make the clock pause (in case circumstances require you to stop it). If the clock isn't
                        running and you didn't start the game yet, this will allow you to switch players in case you
                        chose the wrong player in the opening dialog.
                    </p>
                    <p style="white-space: normal;">
                        The right button, upon bein tapped, will call an extension for the current player. If no more
                        extensions are available, you will be informed. However, you will still have the choice to
                        allow another extension.
